This will generate the basic project structure.\n","\n","2. **Modify your `agents.yaml` file:** Define your agents here.  Each agent will have a role, goal, and backstory.  Variables can be interpolated using curly braces `{}` and will be replaced with values from your main Python file.\n","\n","3. **Modify your `tasks.yaml` file:** Define your tasks. Each task includes a description, expected output, and the agent responsible for completing it.\n","\n","4. **Modify your `crew.py` file:** This file contains the Python code defining your crew.  Use the `@CrewBase`, `@agent`, `@task`, and `@crew` decorators to define your agents, tasks, and the overall crew structure.  You can use tools like `SerperDevTool` within your agents.\n","\n","5. **[Optional] Add before and after crew functions:** Use `@before_kickoff` and `@after_kickoff` decorators to add functions that run before and after the crew execution, respectively.\n","\n","6. **Feel free to pass custom inputs to your crew:**  Pass variables to your crew via a dictionary in your main script to customize the execution.\n","\n","7. **Set your environment variables:** Set necessary environment variables like your OpenAI API key and other relevant keys in a `.env` file.\n","\n","8. **Lock and install the dependencies:** Use the CLI to lock and install the required dependencies.\n","\n","9. **Run your crew:** Execute a command to run your crew.\n","\n","10. **View your final report:**  The output will be displayed in the console, and any output files (specified in your `tasks.yaml`) will be created.\n","\n","**Important Notes from the Quickstart Guide:**\n","\n","* **Naming Consistency:**  Ensure consistency between names in your YAML files (`agents.yaml`, `tasks.yaml`) and the corresponding method names in your `crew.py` file.\n","* **Annotations:** Use the annotations `@agent`, `@task`, `@crew`, etc., correctly to link your YAML configurations with your Python code.\n","* **Process Types:**  The guide demonstrates a sequential process, but you can also use a hierarchical process.\n","* **Replaying Tasks:**  You can replay tasks from previous runs using `crewai replay <task_id>`.\n","* **Resetting Crew Memory:** Use `crewai reset-memory` to clear the crew's memory.\n","* **Deployment:**  The easiest deployment method is through CrewAI Enterprise.\n","\n","\n","This detailed explanation, directly from the CrewAI quickstart guide, should provide Hassan Ali Khan with everything he needs to set up a crewAI agent.

We're thrilled to help you get started with your agent setup.  I understand you're looking to set up a crewAI agent, and I'm happy to guide you through the process.  I've taken a look at the quickstart guide (https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart) and crafted a more detailed and user-friendly explanation below.\n> \n> Let's break down the setup into manageable steps.  Remember, if you get stuck at any point, please don't hesitate to ask! We're here to help.\n> \n> **1. Project Creation and Initial Setup:**\n> \n> First, let's create your crewAI project.  We'll use the command line for this.  The exact command might vary slightly depending on your operating system, but it generally follows this pattern:\n> \n> ```bash\n> crewai create my-piaic-agent\n> ```\n> \n> Replace `my-piaic-agent` with a descriptive name for your project. This command will generate a project directory with the necessary files: `agents.yaml`, `tasks.yaml`, `crew.py`, and potentially others.\n> \n> **2. Defining Your Agents (`agents.yaml`):**\n> \n> The `agents.yaml` file is where you define the agents that will participate in your crew.  Each agent is described with its:\n> \n> * **`role`:**  What is this agent's function within the crew? (e.g., \"Researcher,\" \"Writer,\" \"Summarizer\")\n> * **`goal`:** What is this agent trying to achieve? (e.g., \"Find relevant research articles,\" \"Write a concise summary,\" \"Generate a creative story\")\n> * **`backstory`:** (Optional)  Providing a backstory can help shape the agent's behavior and responses.\n> \n> Here's an example:\n> \n> ```yaml\n> agents:\n>   - role: Researcher\n>     goal: Find relevant research articles on AI ethics.\n>     backstory: A seasoned researcher with a focus on the ethical implications of AI.\n> ```\n> \n> Remember, you can use variables within curly braces `{}` to dynamically populate values from your Python code (explained later).\n> \n> **3. Defining Your Tasks (`tasks.yaml`):**\n> \n> The `tasks.yaml` file outlines the tasks your agents will perform. Each task includes:\n> \n> * **`description`:** A clear description of the task.\n> * **`agent`:** The name of the agent responsible for this task (must match the name in `agents.yaml`).\n> * **`output_file`:** (Optional) Specify a file where the task's output should be saved.  This is extremely helpful for organizing your results.\n> \n> Example:\n> \n> ```yaml\n> tasks:\n>   - description: \"Research AI ethics articles\"\n>     agent: Researcher\n>     output_file: research_results.txt\n> ```\n> \n> **4. Implementing Your Crew Logic (`crew.py`):**\n> \n> This is the heart of your project.  Here, you'll write the Python code that defines the agents' behavior and how they interact.  We use decorators to link your Python code with your YAML configurations.\n> \n> * `@CrewBase`:  This decorator marks the main class that orchestrates the crew.\n> * `@agent`: This decorator defines an agent's functionality.\n> * `@task`: This decorator defines a specific task within an agent.\n> * `@crew`: This decorator defines the overall crew structure.\n> \n> Here's a basic example using the `SerperDevTool`:\n> \n> \n> ```python\n> from crewai import CrewBase, agent, task, crew\n> from serper import SerperAPI\n> \n> @crew\n> class MyCrew(CrewBase):\n>     def __init__(self, api_key):\n>         self.serper = SerperAPI(api_key)\n> \n> @agent\n> class Researcher(MyCrew):\n>     @task\n>     def research_ai_ethics(self):\n>         results = self.serper.search(\"AI ethics\")\n>         with open(\"research_results.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n>             f.write(results)\n> \n> # In your main script:\n> my_crew = MyCrew(api_key=\"YOUR_SERPER_API_KEY\")\n> my_crew.run()\n> \n> ```\n> \n> Remember to replace `\"YOUR_SERPER_API_KEY\"` with your actual API key.\n> \n> **5. Before and After Crew Functions (Optional):**\n> \n> You can add functions that run before and after your crew executes using the `@before_kickoff` and `@after_kickoff` decorators.  This is useful for tasks like setting up the environment or cleaning up afterward.\n> \n> **6.
